# AI-Assisted Project Report (20 points)


### **Question 1: Exploring the SQL Database and HDFS file size (5 points)**

A. How In Part 1, you were asked to use an AI assistant to find the necessary SQL commands to explore the `CS544` database. Using your own words (that is don't copy/paste AI output), summarize the AI's response. List the commands the AI suggested and what you discovered using them, such as the table names and the relevant columns for the join operation.(2 points)

B. List the HDFS command that AI suggested for exploring the file size. (1 point)

C. Using your own words (that is don't copy/paste AI output), summarize the AI's response for your question on why the file size might be different on HDFS. List any additional prompts (do not copy/paste the output for the prompts) that you had to use to get the AI assistant to talk about compression related details.

### **Question 2: Understanding Performance (5 points)**

In Part 3B, you were instructed to ask an AI to explain why partitioned data queries are faster. Summarize the key points from the AI's response. 


### **Question 3: Analyzing NameNode Logs (10 points)**

In Part 4, after killing a DataNode, you were required to collect the NameNode logs and use an AI to analyze them. Based on your interaction with the AI, answer the following:

A. How does the NameNode detect a DataNode failure? (2 points)


B. What specific log messages indicate that blocks are now under-replicated?(2 points)


C. How long did HDFS take to officially mark the DataNode as dead?(3 points)


D. What recovery mechanisms did HDFS attempt automatically?(3 points)
